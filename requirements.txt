# The deployment environment (like Streamlit Cloud) needs to know which
# spaCy model to download. We specify it here conceptually.
# The actual download usually happens via a post-install script or
# is handled automatically if the platform supports it.
# For Streamlit Cloud, simply having 'spacy' listed is often enough,
# and the app code tries to load 'en_core_web_sm'. If deployment fails
# due to the model, you might need platform-specific configuration.
# Ensure your app.py tries to load the correct model ('en_core_web_sm').
